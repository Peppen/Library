Virtual Library in *Java* language with *Swing* library. The aim is to create a software that can handle all the operations that can be performed in a bookstore such as managing the position of a book, managing each shelf and returning/borrowing a book. 

## Behavior
This software creates 3 rooms named **A**, **B**, **C**, each of which has a certain number of shelves; each shelf in turn has 20 positions, initialized empty where you can add a book or delete it. Once you enter a room, you can perform operations on each position on a shelf by simply right-clicking on a position and selecting the operation you want to perform:
* **Deletion**: the book in that position on the shelf, if present, is deleted.
* **Restitution**: the book, if on loan, changes the status becoming *available*.
* **Loan**: the book, if not on loan, changes the status becoming *not available*.
* **Addition**: if the position is not filled, it becomes filled by adding a new book.
* **Details**: show the details of the book in that position, if any.
